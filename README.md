# ngx-layout

## This is a clone of the Angular Flex-Layout repo.

This is the new home for Angular Flex-Layout now called ngx-layout.

**NOTE: The Angular team no longer publishes new releases of this project. Please review [this article](https://medium.com/@caerus.karu/farewell-flex-layout-aaa567023769)
for the explanation and next steps.**

ngx-layout provides a sophisticated layout API using Flexbox CSS + mediaQuery.
This module provides Angular developers with component layout features using a
custom Layout API, mediaQuery observables, and injected DOM flexbox-2016 CSS stylings.

The Flex Layout engine intelligently automates the process of applying appropriate Flexbox CSS to browser view hierarchies. This automation also addresses many of the complexities and workarounds encountered with the traditional, manual, CSS-only application of box CSS.

The **real** power of ngx-layout, however, is its **responsive** engine. The
[Responsive API](https://github.com/ngbracket/ngx-layout/wiki/Responsive-API) enables developers to easily specify different layouts, sizing, visibilities for different viewport sizes and display devices.
